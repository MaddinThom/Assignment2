# Final Exam
I am using my assignment 3 (continued from assignment 2) for the final exam.

Game Description: The game I have built is based off assignment 2. The goal is for the player to collect all the keys which will unlock the door so they can reach the exit pad to win. There are enemies in the game and if they touch you long enough to bring your health to zero you lose. You can also lose by falling off the world.

Using object pool is an improvement because it allows any number of keys or enemies needed be easily accessed and created 

Controls: WASD to move, Right clicking on the path spawns a key, 1 to spawn fast enemy, 2 to spawn slow enemy

Thrid Party Acknowledgement: I used my group's assignment 2 which used: the unity manual to clear a few things up https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html and also used the movement script that we created for our GDW game.
In this assignment we used tutorial 4 and 5 to help with setting up patterns and we used the enemy prefab we created for our GDW game.

Specific to this assignment: I used object pool code from the labs
